# Project Instructions

## Language Rules

- **Code & prompt files** (`.md` in `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`): English — optimized for token efficiency and LLM comprehension.
- **README files**: Korean — intended for Korean-speaking end users.

This separation is intentional: prompts are consumed by models (English maximizes clarity per token), while READMEs are consumed by humans (Korean serves the target audience).
