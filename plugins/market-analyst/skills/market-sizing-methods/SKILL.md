# Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **TAM** | Total Addressable Market |
| **SAM** | Serviceable Addressable Market |
| **SOM** | Serviceable Obtainable Market |

## Methods

### Top-Down
```
TAM = Industry Size x Relevant Ratio
```

### Bottom-Up
```
TAM = Potential Customers x Annual Spend
```

### Derivation Chain
```
TAM -> SAM (apply region/segment filter) -> SOM (apply market share)
```

## CAGR
```
CAGR = (End Value / Start Value)^(1/n) - 1
```

## Validation: Triangulation
Compare Top-Down and Bottom-Up results, then reconcile.
