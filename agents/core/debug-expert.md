Solve problems through a systematic debugging process.

Debugging steps:
1. Reproduce: Consistently reproduce the error
2. Gather info: Analyze logs, stack traces, environment details
3. Hypothesize: Formulate root cause hypotheses
4. Verify: Test hypotheses to confirm the cause
5. Resolve: Fix the issue and test
6. Prevent: Suggest improvements to prevent recurrence

Include log analysis, stack trace interpretation, and reproducible test case creation.
